### About

**PreMOn** (Predicate Model for Ontologies) is a linguistic Linked Data resource representing **predicate** models such as PropBank, NomBank, VerbNet and FrameNet.
PreMOn consists of an **OWL ontology** for modelling predicates with their arguments, selectional constraints, relations and alignments, based on **lemon** (Lexicon Model for Ontologies); and of a set of **RDF datasets** for the main predicate models described using this ontology.

### Features

- modular [OWL ontology](ontology/core.html) (core module with extension for each predicate model)
- based on [lemon](http://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Final_Model_Specification) by the [Ontology-Lexica Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/) at W3C
- datasets available for [PropBank](https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/ace.html) and [NomBank](https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/ace.html)
- download of [dataset dumps](download.html) with [VOID](http://www.w3.org/TR/void/) statistics
- SPARQL [endpoint](query.html) with web interface
- URI dereferencing and navigation
